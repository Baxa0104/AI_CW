# AI Coursework 2025 - Sustainable Transportation & Wildlife Preservation

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for Coursework 2 and Coursework 3 of the **Artificial Intelligence (CMP020N206)** module. The coursework focuses on AI problem-solving techniques applied to **sustainable transportation solutions** and **wildlife preservation strategies**.

## Coursework 2: Sustainable Transportation Solutions
### Description
The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-driven eco-friendly delivery system** that optimizes routes to minimize transportation costs and emissions. The system considers **road networks, delivery destinations, and environmental impact** to find the most efficient paths between cities.

### Tasks
#### Task 1: Define the Map and Searching Problem
- Create a representation of the map with **cities as nodes** and **roads as weighted edges**.
- Allow user input for **start and destination cities**.
- Provide a **default case** where **Manchester** is the starting point and **Inverness** is the destination.

#### Task 2: Implement Search Algorithms
Implement at least three search algorithms:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **A* Search**
- **Additional algorithm (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm)**

#### Task 3: Display Results
- Display the **suggested path** for each algorithm.
- Show **total distance** for each route.

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- **Real-World Data Integration**: Consider real-time traffic, emissions, or weather data.
- **Advanced Search Techniques**: Use Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Multi-Objective Optimization.
- **Ethical and Societal Implications**: Discuss automation's impact on employment and sustainability.

### Dependencies needs to be installed
- **NetworkX**: `pip install networkx`
- **Plotly** `pip install plotly`

## Coursework 3: Wildlife Preservation Strategy Simulator
### Description
This project simulates a **Wildlife Preservation Strategy Game**, modeled after **Tic-Tac-Toe**, to help conservationists balance habitat preservation and urban development pressures. The AI opponent represents environmental threats, and the player takes actions to protect biodiversity.

### Tasks
#### Task 1: Define the Wildlife Simulator
- Implement a **3x3 park habitat grid**.
- Represent different habitat types (e.g., wetlands, meadows, woodlands).
- Define conservation actions that modify the grid state.

#### Task 2: Develop the AI Threat Simulator
- AI opponent responds with environmental threats.
- Implement strategic AI decision-making using **Minimax Algorithm** or **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.

#### Task 3: Run the Simulation
- Allow users to take conservation actions.
- Display the evolving habitat grid.
- Determine the game outcome (successful preservation vs. environmental challenges).

### Advanced Features (Optional)
- **Use real-world biodiversity data**.
- **Encourage ethical AI practices** by promoting sustainable conservation efforts.
- **Expand game complexity** with additional rules and interactions.

## Submission Requirements
Each coursework submission includes:
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** with documented code.
- **PDF Report** containing:
  - Gantt Chart
  - Flowcharts
  - Research references
